# Slapcode
Leetcode, but it really hits ya. *whacc*  
  
**You're on the `softie` branch, if you're a real g, switch to `master`**  
(*these are the easier versions of the problems*)  
  
Not essentially leetcode style, most of these will have you implement something based on a framework.  
Each problem will have a `README.md` with the Rules and Instructions  
  
## General Rules
(these might be overriden by the problem's rules)  
- You may use nightly
- Follow the spirit of the problems
- May not use external crates (some problems import `rand`, this is just for tests)
- Try to do the most micro-optimizations you can think of
- Don't make it absolutely suck (optional)
