# Slapcode
Leetcode, but it really hits ya. *whacc*  
  
Not essentially leetcode style, most of these will have you implement something based on a framework.  
Each problem will have a `README.md` with the Rules and Instructions  
  
**For all my softie fellas**
There's also the `softie` branch, which has easier versions of the problems.  

**After you're done**  
check out the `solutions` branch to see how ye stack up.  
I ye got somethin better do PR!  

## General Rules
(these might be overriden by the problem's rules)  
- You may use nightly
- Follow the spirit of the problems
- May not use external crates (some problems import `rand`, this is just for tests)
- Try to do the most micro-optimizations you can think of
- Don't make it absolutely suck (optional)

## Ideas
- [ ] - bytecode - some kind of bytecode interpreter
- [ ] - atomics  - atmomic ops (needs a threading test)
- [ ] - segfault - fix a codebase that segfaults
- [ ] - bug hunt - find obscure bugs in code
- [ ] - game of life - implement conway's game of life
- [ ] - compression - implement a compression algorithm

if ye wanna add one of these, add a new one to this list, or add somethin else feel free to PR! :D
